This script installs Ollama for you !
It is simply made to make the local AI installation for you simple !

For this script to run properly, please unzip this folder and move the file called **"AI-Install.sh"** to `~/` (your home directory),  
or else you will have to adapt the following command to your directory !

You can run this by opening your terminal and typing:

```bash
~/AI-Install.sh
```
Sometimes, the script refuses to launch, you can fix this by giving the script executable permissions by running:

```bash
chmod +x ./AI-Install.sh -- Assuming you have the installer in your home directory, like the inscructions told you to do !
```

## UPDATE

Added new model called "GPT-oss" that is supposed to be an Open-Source alternative to ChatGPT !
Added a feature that encourages user to run script as root !
###### Other than that, I really did not make many changes, I was tired  -.-
